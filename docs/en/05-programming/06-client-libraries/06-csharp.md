## Frequently Asked Questions

1. "Unable to establish connection", "Unable to resolve FQDN"

   Usually, it's caused by an incorrect FQDN configuration. Please refer to this section in the [FAQ](https://docs.tdengine.com/2.4/train-faq/faq/#2-how-to-handle-unable-to-establish-connection) to troubleshoot.

2. Unhandled exception. System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'taos' or one of its dependencies: The specified module cannot be found.

   This is usually because the program did not find the dependent client driver. The solution is to copy `C:\TDengine\driver\taos.dll` to the `C:\Windows\System32\` directory on Windows, and create the following soft link on Linux `ln -s /usr/local/taos/driver/libtaos.so.x.x .x.x /usr/lib/libtaos.so` will work.
